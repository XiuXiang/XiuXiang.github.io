[{"title":"About My Blog","url":"/2019/12/10/About-My-Blog/","content":"\nWelcome to [my blog](www.vislam.top). This blog is based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). This blog is hosted on [github](https://github.com/XiuXiang/XiuXiang.github.io). The domain name is bought in [aliyun](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/domain/). \n\n## Quick Start Hexo\n\n```bash\n$ hexo clean \n$ hexo g # generate static files\n$ hexo s # run server\n$ hexo d # deploy to remote sites\n$ hexo new \"article title\" #new an article\n```\n\nCheck [documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/) for more info([Writing](https://hexo.io/docs/writing.html), [Server](https://hexo.io/docs/server.html), [Generating](https://hexo.io/docs/generating.html), ). If you get any problems when using Hexo, you can find the answer in [troubleshooting](https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting.html) or you can ask Hexo on [GitHub](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues).\n\n## The process  of building my blog\n#### 2019.12.10 \n\nThe first tutorial I found is [weiyang's Blog](https://godweiyang.com/2018/04/13/hexo-blog/), which is particular for me. After I followed the above tutorial and have a general understanding, I find a [Blog](https://www.huweihuang.com/) that suited my aesthetic value. So I download the [bolg's theme](https://github.com/huweihuang/hexo-theme-huweihuang) and used in my Blog. The theme is reported, the origin author is Hux ( [his blog](http://huangxuan.me/) ), and the [boilerplate](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxblog-boilerplate) is reported on [his github](https://github.com/Huxpro). But the origin theme is based on Jkyll, which is similar to Hexo. I want to use Hux's theme, so I tried to install Jkyll. Well, there is something wrong when I used Jkyll. I just want to have a Blog to record slam technology, but I don't want to waste too much time on front end technology. So I go back to use the reported Hexo theme. \n\nThere is some tutorial to use this theme. [Tutorial by Hux](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io/blob/master/README.zh.md). [Tutorial by huweihuang](https://github.com/huweihuang/hexo-theme-huweihuang)\n\nI found that this theme doesn't support latex equation. That's a big problem for me. so I search \"github blog hexo latex\", and I get the key word : \"mathjax\". so I search \"github hexo mathjax\", I found several tutorial, and [this blog](https://ranmaosong.github.io/2017/11/29/hexo-support-mathjax/) solved my problem. \n\n#### 2019.12.14\n\nI find a [theme](https://github.com/liuyib/hexo-theme-stun) with a aesthetic [tutorial](https://liuyib.github.io/hexo-theme-stun/zh-CN/). [Liuyib's blog](https://liuyib.github.io/).\n\nI decide to use the theme--stun.\n\n#### 2019.12.18\n\nI insert PDF on blog, ref:[how-to-build-a-blog-with-hexo](http://jialunliu.com/how-to-build-a-blog-with-hexo/)\n\nwhat's Relative paths and Absolute path, ref:[path](https://hexo-guide.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/hexo/advanced/资源文件.html)\n\n[Hexo Official tutorial](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/generating) is best, hah\n\n","tags":["Blog"]}]
